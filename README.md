<h3 align="center">Data Analyst</h3>



 - ðŸ’¬ About me:  I like to solve problems ðŸ˜„ Throughout my life, intellectual curiosity has driven me to find answers to any questions. I do not give up! In my own business, I analyzed problems and found solutions by analyzing data.
I strive to apply my experience, combined with my education, to make a positive contribution to the development of the company in which I work. I have experience in data analysis, project management, manufacturing, business operations, sales and market research. I have experience working as self employed as well as in the corporate world, so I have a wide range of skills! There is also research experience. I am a very fast learner and adapt well to new environments.
I love building relationships and working in a team.
